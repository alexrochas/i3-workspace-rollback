# i3 Workspace Rollback
> i3-wm plugin to rollback to last focused workspace

## Installation 

Once I discover how to install and ship it, I swear that I will write it here

## Usage example

With this plugin, you will be able to switch between workspaces and when needed go back to last workspace just press, at least for now, <Mod4>+z.
